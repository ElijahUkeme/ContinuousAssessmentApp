Continuous Assessment App for the department of Computer Science Glory Land Polytchnic Ankpa, Kogi State
This is an Android App that I developed during my NYSC programme at the above mentioned institution to lessen the workload of 
lecturers in the department.
With the app, lecturers will not be concerned anymore about how to give and mark the continuous assessment for the semester anymore as the
only thing they are required is to upload their questions, options and answers to the database and the student will proceed
to write the test using the app and the app will do the marking as well as verification for the qualified students for the lecturer


The course lecturer will upload the questions, options as well as answers to every question into the database that is connected to the app
Will also upload the registration numbers of all the qualified student into the database
Students whose registration number has been uploaded by the course lecturer can then proceed to register for the course using the app
Students whose registration was successfully should then proceed to take his/her test using the app

Important implementation in the app
Firebase for backend
MVVM for clean Architecture
Timer which keeps track of the time used by the student during the process of writing the test and submit the test automatically immediately the time allocated for the test elapsed and the student didn't submit

Navigation component to switch over fragment
etc
